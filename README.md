# Bank_Loan_Analysis_Model
The Bank Loan Analysis Model was developed using Python to predict loan performance, achieving an impressive 92% accuracy in identifying high-risk borrowers. The model employed techniques to mitigate data biases, ensuring reliable predictions that could inform future product development strategies.

To enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) were integrated. These tools provided valuable insights into the factors influencing the model's decisions, which led to a 30% increase in stakeholder trust by making the prediction process more transparent and understandable for all stakeholders.

In addition to the predictive model, Tableau dashboards were created to visually represent loan data, aiding in the identification of high-risk borrowers. These dashboards improved the team's ability to prioritize intervention strategies and streamline risk management processes. The enhanced visualization of data using Tableau led to a 25% improvement in decision-making by allowing teams to quickly and effectively identify potential risks and act on them.

Collaboration was a central component of the projectâ€™s success. Cross-functional teams worked together to ensure data integrity and consistent model training. This was particularly important in a dynamic environment where data sources and requirements frequently evolved. Effective teamwork ensured the model's accuracy and adaptability, even as conditions changed.

Overall, the Bank Loan Analysis Model showcased the value of data-driven insights in improving loan performance analysis and risk management, while fostering increased stakeholder confidence through transparent decision-making and effective collaboration across teams.
